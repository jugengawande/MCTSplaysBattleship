# Computer plays Battleship

<b>Designed by: Jugen Gawande & Dimpy Ghaswala</b>

Battleship is a turn based strategy game. The goal is to arrange your own fleet and destroy enemy fleet before your own fleet is sunk entirely. 
This project develops a tree based ai algorithm that plays battleship against a human. The hope is to beat humans almost everytime. HAPPY FIGHTING.

In order to run this game you need to install <b>pygame, stable_baseline3.</b>
You will also need numpy and pandas if not already installed.
```
pip install stable-baselines3, pygame
```

To play the game launch the GUI using the following command after cloning this project.
```
python launch_game.py
```
To play the game follow the on screen instructions:

 - Enter the grid size to play with. Currently supported are (5,7,10,12,15).
 - Type <b>T</b> to play as a human for Player 1, similarly set Player 2 as <b>T</b> to set player 2 as human.
 - If either Player 1 or 2 is <b>F</b> then the player is AI. If both players are set to <b>F</b> then teh AI plays AI (World domination ðŸ§¨)
 - If you selected <b>F</b> you will have to choose 1 of 3 algorithms to play with for each player.


 - <b>COMPETE MODE: </b>When one player of the player is the computer ai then an option to play in compete mode is presented. If set to <b>T</b> then you can't see the opponents board. Then the game play is like a true game. 

Use the following keys while in game to control the game:

- <b>ESC</b> : Exit the game
- <b>SPACE</b> : Reset the game (Randomizes a new map)

The gamelplay looks like below

The game is interacted using a mouse click. The game shows 2 grid for each player. The left grid is the Ship Grid for a player, to mark where its ships are located and also mark any hits that were made by the opponent. You cannot interact with this grid. 

The right grid is your search effort. If the player is a human player then you can click in the grid boxes on the right to explore a block on the opponent's ship grid. If it is a HIT it will show a YELLOW dot and a BLUE if its a MISS.

You can only click on the search grid (right grid) when it's your chance and you are a human player. The top is player 1 and the bottom is player 2. 



The analysis of the algorithm can be found in the the gameplay_analysis.ipynb
