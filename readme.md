Designed by: Jugen Gawande & Dimpy Ghaswala

Battleship is a turn based strategy game. The goal is to arrange your own fleet and destroy enemy fleet before your own fleet is sunk entirely. 
This project develops a tree based ai algorithm that plays battleship against a human. The hope is to beat humans almost everytime. HAPPY FIGHTING.
