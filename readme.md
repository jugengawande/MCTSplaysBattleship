This project develops a tree based ai algorithm that plays battleship against a human. The hope is to beat humans almost everytime. HAPPY FIGHTING.

 - Enter the grid size to play with. Currently supported are (5,7,10,20).
 - Type <b>T</b> to play as a human for Player 1, similarly set Player 2 as <b>T</b> to set player 2 as human.
 - If either Player 1 or 2 is <b>F</b> then you are playing against the computer ai. If both players are set to <b>F</b> then teh AI plays AI (World domination ðŸ§¨)
 - <b>COMPETE MODE: </b>When one player of the player is the computer ai then an option to play in compete mode is presented. If set to <b>T</b> then you can't see the opponents board.
