# Computer plays Battleship

Designed by: Jugen Gawande & Dimpy Ghaswala

Battleship is a turn based strategy game. The goal is to arrange your own fleet and destroy enemy fleet before your own fleet is sunk entirely. 
This project develops a tree based ai algorithm that plays battleship against a human. The hope is to beat humans almost everytime. HAPPY FIGHTING.

To play the game launch the GUI using the following command after cloning this project.
```
python launch_game.py
```

The terminal will ask for a grid size to play and settings to set if the player is human or computer.
To play against the computer set Player 1 to <b>T</b> and Player 2 as <b>F</b>. 

To play a true game of battleship set the next prompt to <b>T</b>. In this you want be able to see the Player 2's grid.

The gamelplay looks like below
